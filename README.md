# Billing Budget Definition on Google Cloud Platform

Project developed at the Bootcamp Cloud DevOps Experience - Banco Carrefour with guidance from specialist [Carlos Gomes](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carlos-barbero-95457b22/ "Carlos Gomes").
Learning how to create alerts and a real budget definition to control their use within the GCP platform and understand in practice how Billing settings work.

Some points that should be taken into consideration:

- Weekly Compute Engine costs with alerts configured at 20%, 45%, 80% to receive the alert in advance when reaching 80%.

- Kubernets quarterly costs with alerts configured at 40%, 80%, 100% to receive the alert when reaching the maximum limit.

- Monthly CDN costs with alerts configured at 50%, 90%, 100% to receive the alert when reaching the maximum limit.
